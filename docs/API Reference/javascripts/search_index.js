The middle line stretches along the width of the widget represents remaining battery percentage of the aircraft. If remaining battery is 100%, the line will cover the whole width of widget. If remaining battery is 0%, the line will disappear.   - Red part of the line represents the battery percentage needed   to land aircraft immediately.   - Yellow part of the line represents the battery percentage needd to   return aircraft home.   - Green part of the line represents the battery percentage left to fly safely. 3. The two white dots represent the two settable battery threshold.   - The first one from the left represents the land immediately threshold.   - The second one represents the go home threshold. 4. The `H` icon is an addition to yellow part of the line. It represents the battery percentage needed to go home.  Usage: Preferred Aspect Ratio: 612:12",
